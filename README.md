# Advent of CSS 2022 - Day 9 - Image Carousel

This is my submission for day 9 of the [Advent of CSS](https://www.adventofcss.com/) challenge.

I have used the Figma layout from the starter files to reproduce the design as closely as possible keeping in mind the functionality of the app, which I intend to implement in a separate repository for the corresponding [Advent of JS](https://www.adventofjs.com/) challenge.

I have created this layout without help from the material provided in the solution tier of the challenge and tried my best to use semantic HTML and BEM methodology for naming CSS classes. For the initial submission I have also kept to plain CSS, with plans to translate these into SASS/SCSS on a separate branch of this repo when time permits.
